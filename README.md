# What is Liferary?

> Project name "Liferary" created by combining "Life" and "Library".  
It means a library with knowledges for a better life.

<div align="justify">
  <b>"Liferary"</b> is a free knowledge-sharing service that combines the concept of wikis, where users can make free contributions, with paid online education services. The platform's key feature is that "knowledge sharers" can publish their knowledge in various forms, such as text, images, and videos (via YouTube), and share them with others. Knowledge sharers can also use Google Meet, a real-time video conferencing service, to conduct study sessions. Users can learn from the shared knowledge and express their opinions through the community service. Liferary aims to enable as many people as possible to lead better lives by sharing knowledge with one another.
